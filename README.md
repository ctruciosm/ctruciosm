### Hi everyone, I'm Carlos ðŸ‘‹

I am Assistant Professor of Quantitative Methods in the **Faculty of Business Administration and Accounting at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro** - Brazil. Here some things about me:

- I am a peruvian guy based in Brazil since 2010.
- I hold a PhD in Statistics from University of Campinas (UNICAMP) - Brazil.
- I mostly code in R, sometimes in Matlab and occasionally in Python.
- I am always interested in new statistical/econometrics stuff.
- I really like Time Series Analysis and its applications in Economics and Finance (thanks Luiz Hotta). You can see more about my research interests as well as my list of publications [here](https://ctruciosm.github.io/research.html).
- I strongly believe that education changes our lives.

I am currently working on high-dimensional time series (specifically on General Dynamic Factor Models -- GDFM), risk measures forecasting procedures, machine learning methods applied to finance and a little bit in text mining.

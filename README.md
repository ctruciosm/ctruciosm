### Hi everyone ðŸ‘‹

I am Assistant Professor at **University of Campinas** (Department of Statistics) - Brazil. About myself...

- I am a peruvian based in Brazil since 2010.
- I hold a PhD in Statistics from University of Campinas (UNICAMP) - Brazil.
- I usually code in [R](https://cran.r-project.org), sometimes in Matlab and occasionally in Python.
- I am curious about [Julia Lang](https://julialang.org)
- I am always interested in new statistical/econometrics methods and open for collaborative work.
- I really like Time Series Analysis and its applications in Economics and Finance (thanks Luiz Hotta). You can see more about my research interests as well as my list of publications [here](https://ctruciosm.github.io/research.html).
- I strongly believe that education changes our lives.

I am currently working on high-dimensional time series (specifically on General Dynamic Factor Models -- GDFM), risk measures forecasting procedures, machine learning porfolio allocation strategies and a little bit in text mining.
